        title: "Machine Learning Researcher",
        description: `Led a cross-disciplinary team of chemists and engineers to develop a deep learning model for molecule elucidation, consulting Dr. Kylie Luksa for domain-specific knowledge in spectroscopy. Built and optimized a custom GPU rig, enabling the training of the model on 15,000 molecular samples over 20 hours, significantly reducing computational bottlenecks. Designed a multimodal architecture combining a fine-tuned CNN with an MLP for IR images alongside an LLM2Vec-based NMR text encoder, achieving 93% accuracy in molecule prediction and a 91% F1 score for functional group detection. Implemented SMOTE, data normalization, and augmentation techniques to reduce class imbalance by 30%, improving model generalization. Set the foundation for future deployment as a real-time tool for chemical analysis, with potential applications in drug discovery and material science `,
